# Contributing to Riplrr

## How to report bugs
- Report them in Issues on GitHub, preferably with a full description, logs, version and reproduction instructions.

## How to submit patches
- Fork the repo, create a meaningfully named branch (e.g. fix/bug-123).
- Write clear, descriptive commits.
- Make a pull request and wait for review.
- Don't spam and be patient.

## Code standards
- 4 spaces instead of tabs.
- Comments only where really needed.
- Split code into files according to the project structure.
- Add tests if you can.

## Copyright
- Make sure you have the rights to the code you're adding.
- Don't upload code from other projects without permission.
- When you create code as someone outside the regular Riplrr team, you waive copyright to that code for the benefit of the project.
